/*Intro:*/

/****Cascading means that if we have two selectors that select the same element(like below), the one that is written later will be applied.
li{color: red; color:blue;} ****/
/****Also if we have to styling files that have two different links in our html file, the one that is written later(the 2nd link) will be applied.****/

/*There are three ways to add css to html:*/
/*1- inline: by adding style attribute to the element. for example: <h1 style="color: red;">Hello World</h1>*//****Not Recommended****/
/*2- internal: by adding style tag to the head of the html file. for example: <style>h1{color: red;}</style>*/
/*3- external: by adding a link tag to the head of the html file. for example: <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">*/

/*******************Caution*******************/

/*colspan only works for <td> and <th> tags and should be written in html as an inline css code for that specific box.*/

/*******************Main Frame*******************/

Selector{property: value;}
/*Selector is the element you want to style, property is the style you want to change, and value is the value you want to set it to.*/
/*the thing is, when we select an element like h1 or p, we are selecting all of them. So if we want to select only one of them, we need to give it a class .*/
/*To give an element a class, we use the class attribute.*/
/*<h1 class="classname">Hello World</h1>*/
/*Now, we can select it using .classname*/

/********Four different categories to style an element********/

/*1- color: we can change the color of the text, background, border, ...*/
/*2- text: we can change the font, size, style, ...*/
/*3- box model: we can change the size, border, margin, padding, ...*/
/*4- position: we can change the position of the element, ...*/

    /****Hexadecimal system has 16 choices: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F--A is number 10 and F 15*/
    /*The system for colors works like this: from #000000 to #ffffff -- The two first are Red chanel, 2nd ones are Green and last two are blue chanel */
    /* ff is 15*15 which is 255*/
    /*color-scheme is used to change the color of the text based on the color of the background.*/
    /***We can use this link to find the pallet of colors that we want: https://colorhunt.co/and this one as mixer:https://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/rgb-mixer/***/

/*********************different Sizes*********************/

/*1PX = 1/96th inch = 0.26mm x 0.26mm(**It's not recommended for responsive websites**)
1 PT = 1/72nd inch = 0.35 mm
1 em = 100% of parent- It's full width of letter 'm'
It means, if e.x. we set h1 to 1em and let's say it's a child of body, and body's font-size is 20px then h1 will be 100% like body, and if we set it to 2em the font size will be 40px.
So first we have to set a size for body then adjust different font sizes for different elements, based on that size by using em.
1 rem = 100% of root (html tag)
If we want to use relative font size, it's better to use rem instead of em. Because soon everything is going to be messy due to that parenting issue*/

Length values: Any length value, like pixels (px), em, or percentages (%). For instance, background-position: 50px 100px; will position the background image 50px from the left and 100px from the top of the container.

Percentage values: The position of the upper left corner of the image is placed at that same percentage position in the container. For instance, background-position: 50% 50%; will center the image in the container.

Keyword values: The following keywords can be used: top, right, bottom, left, and center. You can use one keyword for the horizontal position (left or right), and one for the vertical position (top or bottom). For instance, background-position: right top;.

Multiple values: If you are using multiple background images, you can specify a position for each image, separated by commas. For example, background-position: 50px 100px, center;.

Global keywords: inherit, initial, and unset. */

/*The much more common way:*/

/*Defining the min-width values in media queries is subjective and depends on your specific design requirements and breakpoints. However, there are some common approaches and widely used breakpoints that you can consider when setting the min-width values. These breakpoints are based on common device sizes and can serve as a starting point for creating responsive designs. Here are a few commonly used min-width values:

Small mobile devices (portrait orientation):
min-width: 320px or min-width: 375px (for devices like iPhones)
Mobile devices (landscape orientation) and small tablets:
min-width: 480px or min-width: 568px (for landscape mobile devices)
min-width: 768px (for small tablets like iPads)
Tablets and medium-sized screens:
min-width: 1024px (for larger tablets and some laptops)
min-width: 1280px (common for desktop and laptop screens)
Large screens and high-resolution displays:
min-width: 1440px (common for large desktop monitors)
min-width: 1920px (for high-resolution displays and wide screens)
Extra-large screens:
min-width: 2560px (for ultra-wide screens and large displays)
Keep in mind that these are general suggestions, and you should adapt them based on your specific design and target audience. It's essential to test your website on different devices and adjust the breakpoints accordingly to ensure optimal responsiveness.*/

/* the first value for the first media query based on min-width should typically be the breakpoint for smaller mobile devices. A common starting point is:

// X-Small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)

// Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)
@media (min-width: 576px) { ... }

// Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)
@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

// Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)
@media (min-width: 992px) { ... }

// X-Large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)
@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }

// XX-Large devices (larger desktops, 1400px and up)
@media (min-width: 1400px) { ... }*/

/*This method is whats described as mobile-first. We first design for the lowest viewport and move our way up to larger

displays.

An alternative way is to use max-width. This allows us to go the other direction. Design for desktop first and move

down to smaller screen sizes.

// X-Small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)
@media (max-width: 575.98px) { ... }

// Small devices (landscape phones, less than 768px)
@media (max-width: 767.98px) { ... }

// Medium devices (tablets, less than 992px)
@media (max-width: 991.98px) { ... }

// Large devices (desktops, less than 1200px)
@media (max-width: 1199.98px) { ... }

// X-Large devices (large desktops, less than 1400px)
@media (max-width: 1399.98px) { ... }*/

/*The desktop-first approach is the opposite of the mobile-first approach. It means that we start with the desktop version and then we make it responsive for smaller devices.*/
